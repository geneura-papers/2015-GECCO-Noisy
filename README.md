## Title

Games are noisy: analyzing and dealing with noisy fitness in game design via evolutionary algorithms

## Abstract

Design of games is a noisy affair: in almost every aspect, be it procedural content generation or bot design, it is almost impossible to get a deterministic result for the evaluation of an individual; this means that fitness of an individual is almost always noisy, and we will have to deal with it. However, different types and amplitudes of noise will need different approaches. In this paper we analyze and model noise in three different game-related problems: the design of ghost bots for Ms. PacMan, the evolution of a player bot for Planet Wars, and finally, the generation of backstories for game characters. This model is then applied to the design of operators for evolutionary algorithms that take it into account so that its impact is minimized.
